title: How I cracked CISSP?
---


People always ask me how I did it? Well, folks the wait is over let me show you the magic trick of cracking CISSP. I hope there is a magic trick <i>sigh!</i> 

So lets get started!!

<b>Study materials:</b> 

<b>Sybex, 7th edition:</b> My primary book. Read end-to-end. To the point, no bull$hit.   

<b>Shon Harris, 6th edition:</b> My reference book. Very good explanation. They say old is gold and they're right . Almost 90% of the book is relevant to the new exam. I did all the questions as well of this book which was much better than Sybex.  

<b>Shon Harris practice questions:</b> Awesome collection of questions. Must do!!  

<b>Cccure quiz:</b> OK types not as good as shon harris's questions but good explanations of every question. Must read all the explanations. 

<b>Cybrary videos:</b> Good refresher with tips.  

<b>Sybex test engine:</b> I took only 2 quizzes out of 4, not very helpful. Easily scored 85% in under 2 hours. 

<i>Note:</i> Its not about how many books you read or how many questions you do. Its about how clear your concepts are. It about your attitude towards the examination, about the time management and how you deal with each question in the exam. It's one of the toughest exam I've faced but if you'll go with the right attitude you can easily nail it. All the best!!
