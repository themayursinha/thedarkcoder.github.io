Intelligence Foundations
* Indicators of Attacks (IoA)
* Indicators of Compromise (IoC)
* Tactics Techniques & Procedures (TTPs)
* Collaborative Research Into Threats (CRITS)
    * Open Source Malware Repository
* Raw data & aggregated data
* Security Information & Event Management (SIEM)
* Intrusion Detection/Protection System (IDPS)
* Cyber attack stages
    * Recon
    * Scanning
    * Access & Escalation
    * Exfiltration
    * Sustainment
    * Assault
    * Obfuscation
* The Intelligent Lifecycle
    * Planning and direction
    * Collection
    * Processing and exploitation
    * Analysis and production
    * Dissemination and integration

Cyber Threat Intelligence Perceptions
* How is a threat defined?
    * An agent or entity that exploits a vulnerability
    * An indication or warning of probable trouble
    * Threat & vulnerability pairing
* Interpreting Risk
    * Positive risk -  Risk worth taking
    * Negative risk - Not taking an action
* What is the potential for gaining or losing something of value?
* What is the purpose of CTI?
    * Timely, relevant and actionable
    * Threat hunting
    * Network defense
    * Incident response
* Analysts within the organisation
    * Tactical
    * Operational
    * Strategic
* Detect and respond to Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
* Validate external information to avoid bad intelligence
* What are Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)?
    * Unusual outbound traffic
    * Privileged user account activity anomalies
    * Geolocation anomalies
    * Login-related issues
    * Increase in database read activity
    * Unusual HTML response size
    * Numerous requests for the same file
    * Application port mismatch
    * System file & registry changes
    * Strange DNS requests
    * Data cached in suspicious locations
    * Patching anomalies
    * Bot-related web activity
    * DDoS symptoms & activity

Tactical Threat Intelligence
* The tactical threat intelligence analyst role
    * What should an organisation focus upon during incident response?
* Required Skills & Capabilities
    * Network defender
    * Threat hunting
    * Incident detection & response
    * Attribution concerns
        * A cognitive bias refers to the systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, whereby inferences about other people and situations may be drawn in an illogical fashion.
        * Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for interpret, favour, and recall information in a way that confirms oneâ€™s preexisting
    * The cyber kill chain
        * Reconnaissance
        * Weaponisation
        * Delivery
        * Exploitation
        * Installation
        * Command & Control (CnC)
        * Actions on objectives
        * 
* The IOC life cycle
    * Discover
    * Analyse
    * Leverage
* Free IOC tools
    * IoC creation
    * Display IoCs
    * Identify Suspect system
    * Collect and preserve evidence
    * Analyse data
    * Cyber threat maps

Operational Threat Intelligence
* Analyst role
    * Focused on the day-to-day environment
    * Adversary oriented activities
        * Practical analysis of intruder TTPs
    * Analyses internally and externally collected info
        * Emphasis on credible threat feeds
        * Focus on emerging technology
    * Distributes intel products focused on actors, campaigns, opportunities and intent
    * What benefits are realised from sharing information?
        * Coordination with other analysts
        * Correlation of IOCs discovered by other teams
        * Helps determine whether an event is an incident
        * Improve overall analysis
    * Intelligence management methods
        * Information Sharing and analysis centre (ISAC)
            * Establish a plan for collection of data (internal & external)
            * Identify key stakeholders from member companies
            * Specify producers and consumers of intel
            * Create sharing incentives for stakeholders
            * Ultimate goals are to store, analyse and share credible intel
* Using the diamond model
    * Adversary
    * Capability
    * Victim
    * Infrastructure
* Meta-data
    * Timestamp
    * Phase
    * Result
    * Direction
    * Methodology
    * Resources
* 
* Threat actors and campaigns
    * Cyber criminals
    * Hacktivists
    * State sponsored
    * Privileged insider

Strategic Threat Intelligence
* Analyst role
    * How does an organisation defend itself over the long term?
    * Intelligence is used by senior management to measure risk and make risk based decisions
    * Focused on alignment of business goals of the organisation with intelligence
    * Business risk, cyber threats and related risks are correlated and analysed
* Threat Modeling
    * Systematic analysis of attack vectors, attacker profiles and high-value assets
        * Assessment scope
        * System modeling
        * Identify threats
        * Identify vulnerabilities
        * Examining threat history
        * Evaluation of business impact
        * Developing a security threat response plan
    * NIST SP 800-30
        * Appendix D
